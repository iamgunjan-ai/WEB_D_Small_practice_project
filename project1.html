        <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
        <p>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, often referred to as the 
        "Missile Man of India," was a renowned India
        scientist and the 11th President of India. Born on 
        October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he 
        emerged from humble beginnings to become a leading 
        figure in India's space and missile programs.

        Kalam's contributions to India's aerospace industry
        were monumental. He played a pivotal role in the 
        development of India's first indigenous satellite
        launch vehicle and the successful Pokhran-II 
        nuclear tests. His visionary leadership led to 
        the evolution of India as a self-reliant space 
        power.</p>
